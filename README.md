# Stopwatch Project
This is a simple Stopwatch web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The stopwatch has two main features: start/stop/reset functionality and a lap display that shows lap time and lap differences between consecutive laps.

Features
1. Start/Stop/Reset Buttons: The application begins with a Start button.
After clicking the Start button, it changes to Reset to Lap and Start to Stop buttons.
You can stop the stopwatch with the Stop button, and reset it back to zero with the Reset button.
Lap Time Display:

2. The stopwatch allows you to record multiple laps.
It displays the Lap Number, Lap Time, and the Time Difference between consecutive laps.


Technologies Used:
1. HTML: Structuring the layout of the stopwatch.
2. CSS: Styling the appearance of the stopwatch and lap table.
3. JavaScript: Managing the stopwatch's functionality (timing, start/stop/reset buttons, and lap recording).
4. Bootstrap: Used for responsive design and styling of buttons and layout components.
